                    Most of the companies are affected from the pandemic
                    and the world needs a while to fix the damage.
                    Currently the virus killed over 3 millions people and
                    over 150 millions people got sick.
                    (Over 120 million people recovered.)

                    The space companies are racing and being callobrative
                    at the same time for going to another planet. SpaceX
                    wants to send something to Mars to build some needed
                    capabilities on there for a future manned mission.
                    They wants to send humans to Mars which is a very very
                    risky mission and Elon Musk verifies that by saying
                    "You might not come back." it's easier to send people
                    in one way instead of sending and bringing back.<br />

                <h3>Y2K Problem v2 (Y2k38)</h3>
                <h4>All The 32-bit devices like old cell phones (made in 2010s and older) will not be able to work
                    anymore</h4>
                <p><strong>Why will this happen?</strong><br />
                    Most of the computers has a built-in clock in it,
                    if you remove the clock then computer can't boot.
                    You need to make a special Operating System for it
                    to work without clock. The source of the problem
                    starts at right here: These clocks are some sort of
                    a mechanism that increments a number by 1/sec and
                    it's start date is 1 Jan 1970 00:00:00
                    (when the number is 0) for example if the number is
                    100 then the date will be 1 Jan 1970 00:01:40.
                    This clock has a limit and limit is 2³¹-1 = 2,147,483,647
                    which means 03:14:07 on Tuesday, 19 January 2038.
                    When the clock arrives to it's limit, it goes to
                    the smallest possible integer which is minus 2,147,483,648
                    for 32-bit clocks so the date will go back to
                    20:45:52 on Friday, 13 December 1901 and most of the
                    programs will be crashed because of this problem.

                <p>
                    There will be artificial meats that will be very very expensive,
                    only rich people will be able to buy it. Currently some scientific,
                    researches showed that we can really produce artifical meats.
                    Instead of killing animals to get meat, scientists are trying
                    to make artificial meats healthy and cheap. When they succeed,
                    we won't need to kill any animal for obtaining meat. <br>
                    <br>
                    With artificial meat production, there is also some work for
                    making meat grow on plants. In a Conference named New Harvest made in
                    2018, Dr. Glenn Gaudette told the idea. Some scientists tried and
                    succeed on making meat plants. The advantage of this is, we will be
                    able to produce meats very very cheap. But there is insufficent
                    work for this, we don't know if this is healthy or not, or how can we
                    make this idea healthier.

                    Forest firest will triple it's amount. There will be
                    very very big forest fires that will take very long time

                    Nearly half of Amazon Forests will be destroyed. <br>

                    1999 (Cosmic Call 1) and 2003 (Cosmic Call 2) to various
                    nearby stars. The messages were designed with noise-resistant

                    People have chance to design their babies genetics, also most

                    The telescope in Earth can be affected by us sometimes.
                    Lights, radio traffic, pollution and etc. So NASA decided
                    to make a radio telescope in Moon.

                        "A radio telescope is a specialized antenna and radio
                        receiver used to detect radio waves from astronomical
                        radio sources in the sky."

                    <br>
                    "An ultra-long-wavelength radio telescope on the far-side of the Moon has tremendous advantages
                    compared to Earth-based and Earth-orbiting telescopes, including: (i) Such a telescope can observe
                    the universe at wavelengths greater than 10m (i.e., frequencies below 30MHz), which are reflected by
                    the Earth's ionosphere and are hitherto largely unexplored by humans, and (ii) the Moon acts as a
                    physical shield that isolates the lunar-surface telescope from radio interferences/noises from
                    Earth-based sources, ionosphere, Earth-orbiting satellites, and Sun’s radio-noise during the lunar
                    night." <br>

                    SpaceX is planning to make a space station in Mars
                    which includes humans. So we will be able to observe
                    Mars better also this Space Station can be converted
                    into something like Flight Control Tower which works
                    for rockets instead of planes.

                    be a new mining type for mining asteroids. According
